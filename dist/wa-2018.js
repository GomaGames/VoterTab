Governor Jay Inslee has urged the legislature to push through legislation in 2014 and then again earlier this year, to no avail. In 2016, a carbon tax made its way to the ballot, but was handily defeated. Now comes I-1631, a carbon “fee” that would be applied to most businesses that emit carbon, though some industries and employers are left off the list. Those impacted would pay $15 per ton starting in 2020, a fee that would increase by $2 each year until reduction goals are met. The bulk of revenue would be invested in clean energy, with the remainder going to protect natural resources and assist communities overburdened by pollution.",

The measure would also require gun owners to securely store their firearms and increase penalties up to a felony if a weapon is allowed into the hands of someone not authorized to possess one. Gun sellers would also be required to inform a buyer of the risks of a firearm. The measure nearly didn’t make the ballot after a Thurston County judge deemed the language unclear.
